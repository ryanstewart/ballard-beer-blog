*Tap* *Tap*....Is this thing on?

After a long hiatus where work has been busy and the family has been active, I'm trying to get back in the saddle and be a bit more consistent. Especially since Ballard beer has never been more exciting. We've got a new taproom, Urban Family is moving to Magnolia, and Stoup won a gold medal.

To kick things back off I walked over to Reuben's today and got my hands on some London Calling. Sadly I had to miss the event on Wednesday where London Calling was on cask, but they've still got some left in the tap room. And to those who got to try this on cask: I hate you. This beer was meant for the cask.

toffee, blue berry, lightly bitter.
