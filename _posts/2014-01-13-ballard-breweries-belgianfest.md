<div class="img-small-right">![Belgianfest 2014](/img/belgianfest-logo-home.jpg "Belgianfest 2014")</div>[Belgianfest](http://www.washingtonbeer.com/belgianfest/) always looks like one of the best Washington Beer events out there but for a variety of reasons I haven't ever been able to make it. Unfortunately this year is no different (I'll be in India). But for those in town it seems like a perfect way to kick off Super Bowl weekend. Plus, Ballard breweries are well represented. 

Hale's Ales, Peddler, Reuben's, Stoup, and Urban Family are all going to be pouring beers. No word yet on which beers are going to be available, but I'm excited to see what they do. Urban Family in particular has the awsome [Smoke Beer Erryday](https://untappd.com/b/urban-family-brewing-smoke-beer-erryday/476236) smoked Saison that's a great example of new American craft beer meeting old world Belgian tradition. 

Tickets [are available now](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/535773) and *always* sell out, so grab them while you can. 

The event is at:
