According to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/HilliardsBeer/status/423592544166215680) and [their website](http://hilliardsbeer.com/taproom), Hilliard's has added Wednesday to their open days. They'll now be open 3PM to 11PM on Wednesdays through Fridays.

It's awesome to watch these breweries start to be open more and more. It means the demand is there which means the brewing economy of Ballard is trucking right along. I'm looking forward to a world where Monday - Friday afternoon there are lots of brewery choices for thirsty Ballardites.
