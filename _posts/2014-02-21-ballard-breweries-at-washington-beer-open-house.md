<div class="img-small-right">![Washington Beer Commission's 2014 WA Beer Open House](/img/posts/open-house_200x207.jpg "[Washington Beer Commission's 2014 WA Beer Open House")</div>A ton of Ballard breweries are participating in the [Washington Beer Commission's 2014 WA Beer Open House](http://www.washingtonbeer.com/open-house/) this Saturday, the 22nd, and from what I've seen our neighborhood breweries are going to have some great stuff on tap. 

The open house is billed as a way to get to see the inner workings of breweries around the state and many of the breweries are going to be offering tours and the brewers should be around to answer questions. Some breweries even sound like they're going to be offering souvenirs. Here in Ballard we have 6 breweries participating. 

Hilliard's and Hale's are both participating but I'm not sure exactly what they have planned above and beyond their normal Saturday offerings. The others have tours and special beers planned.

##Maritime Pacific
Maritime had this info in their newsletter:

>Starting at 12:15PM, we will have tours every hour until the last tour at 4:15PM. Come check out the Jolly Roger Taproom for beer specials and specialty beers!

>Come in, chat with our brewers, enjoy come fresh and local beer, and check out Maritime Pacific's brewing facilities! We hope to see you there!

##NW Peaks
NW Peaks is going to be tapping their Challenger IPA on cask, and it sounds like their [whiskey barrel aged Double Redoubt](https://untappd.com/b/nw-peaks-brewery-barrel-aged-double-redoubt/469131) will be on tap as well.

##Reuben's 
Reuben's has some special beer offerings planned running the gamut from barrel-aged stouts to their brand new triple IPA on tap and on cask.

- [Bourbon Barrel Imperial Stout](https://untappd.com/b/reuben-s-brews-bourbon-barrel-imperial-stout/315955) (World Beer Championship Gold Medal Winner) will make a rare appearance!
- Bourbon Barrel Auld Heritage will be on tap!
- A brand new barrel aged brew - our Imperial Porter aged in rye whiskey barrels!
- [Blimey](https://untappd.com/b/reuben-s-brews-blimey-that-s-bitter/592468) will be on tap!
- The final cask of quad-hopped Blimey will be tapped at noon!

##Stoup

According to the [Washington Beer Blog](http://www.washingtonbeerblog.com/washington-beer-open-house-saturday-2/), Stoup will be doing tours of their awesome facility. 

>We will be offering brewery tours every hour on the 1/2 hour. First one is at 12:30 and the last is at 4:30.

The festivities run from noon until 5:00 officially but some of the breweries may stick to their normal Sunday hours. It seems like the perfect time to organize a Ballard Beer crawl and hit up some great, rare Ballard beers.
