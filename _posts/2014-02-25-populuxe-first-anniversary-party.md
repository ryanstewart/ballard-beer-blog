I just got word that next **Saturday, March 8th**, Populuxe is going to be blowing it out with a great-sounding party to celebrate their first anniversary. The party has something for all ages, live music, great food, and special beers. Basically a perfect Saturday outing.

They're going to have [Dizzy's Trumble Bus](http://dizzys-tumblebus.com/) on hand for the kiddos from 3:00 - 5:00 which means you can enjoy some great beer while the kids are burning off energy and (literally) bouncing off the walls.

There's also a great live music lineup from 3:00 - 9:30 that night:

* 3-3:30 The Graces-classical duo flute, harp, piano
* 3:30-4:30 Dobrero Band-classic rock
* 4:30-5 Melissa Levi
* 5-5:30 Bridgette Kern
* 5:30-6:30 KJTJ-eclectic rock/pop
* 6:30-7:30 Mother of Pearl-original music, soulful female lead
* 7:30-8:30 theZim & Arock-indie-folk-hop-tronica
* 8:30-9:30 Willie and the Whips--danceable country blues, cd release and potential bull whip demo
* DJ SNAX fills in the blanx

To make sure you don't go hungry, they're going to have [Happy Grillmore](http://www.happygrillmore.com/REVIEWS.html) serving up burgers and fries. The burgers look gigantic and delicious so should go very well with beer and bouncing. Actually, maybe bouncing first, then giant burgers for the kids.

And the coup de grace, by far, is the special release of Old Oddvars Anniversary Ale. The name is an homage to the brewery's Ballard roots and is the name of the [locally famous, Volvo-specialty autoshop](http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/It-ll-be-odd-without-Oddvar-under-the-hood-1141339.php) which used to be located where Populuxe is now brewing. Any shout out to Old Ballard gets a thumbs up from me and it's tough to get more Ballard than Oddvars. The beer combines old and new world hops and malt, is pitched with English yeast, and spent time in cold storage which makes the beer, in the words of Populuxe, a *"strong dry ale, smooth, delicious, and dangerously drinkable"*. It clocks in at 9.0% ABV, so dangerously drinkable sounds about right.

The beer will be available at the brewery starting the 8th, but will also be at "select outlets" but I'm not sure if that means 22oz or on tap (I'll find out). The beer geek stats:

**OG:** 1.084
**IBU:** 54
**SRM:** 12.4
**ABV:** 9.0%

Hopefully I'll see you there! I'll be the one trying to keep my one year old from eating gravel with one eye on my 4 year old tearing up (hopefully not literally) the tumble bus. probably double-fisting Old Oddvars and definitely taking pictures.
