<div class="img-small-right">![Reuben's Blimey That's Bitter](/img/reubens-blimey-thats-bitter.png "Reuben's Blimey That's Bitter")</div>IPA lovers rejoice. According to the Washington Beer Blog, Reuben's, Populuxe and Stoup will take part in the [Washington Hop Mob Triple IPA Roadshow](http://www.washingtonbeerblog.com/cavalcade-of-ipa-local-breweries-present-series-of-events-focused-on-triple-ipa/). What exactly is that? It's a series of events around the city that will be showcasing the hoppiest of hoppy beers from breweries around Seattle. 

The brewery list is impressive and includes 3 from our neck of the woods. I don't have details on what Stoup or Populuxe will be cooking up, but Washington Beer Blog covered Reuben's beer which is going to be called [Blimey That's Bitter](http://www.washingtonbeerblog.com/washington-hop-mob-triple-ipa-roadshow-beer-lineup/). It's going to be Reuben's first stab at a triple IPA and I can't wait to try it. 

Washington Beer Blog has the stats:

>Beer name: Blimey That's Bitter!

>Expected ABV: 10.5

>Expected IBU: 80

>Hops: Citra, Simcoe and Amarillo

>Malt: Gambrinus Pale, Caramel, Munich, Wheat, and a little sugar to make sure that the beer doesn't get too sweet.

>This is Reuben's Brews' first go at a Triple IPA. As the name implies, Blimey That's Bitter will focus on hop aroma and flavors - largely pine, citrus and tropical fruit. Reuben's plans to "hop burst" this beer, meaning the vast majority of the hops will be in the last 10 minutes of the boil. And since it's a Triple IPA, they will also dry hop the brew three times! They'll also be bottling a small amount of Blimey, so keep an eye out for further details.

I love anything with Amarillo hops so I'm anxiously awaiting this beer. And it's going to be available in bottles as well!

We'll keep you posted on what's coming from Stoup and Populuxe.

Current expected dates and locations from the Washington beer blog are as follows:

- Monday, February 17 at Brouwer's Cafe (Seattle)
- Thursday, February 20 at Pike Pub and Brewery (Seattle)
- Wednesday, February 26 at Special Brews (Lynnwood)
- Wednesday, March 5  at Pint Defiance (Tacoma)
- Thursday, March 13 at Naked City Brewery and Taphouse (Seattle)

I've already got the Brouwer's and Naked City dates on my calendar. Hope to see you there!
