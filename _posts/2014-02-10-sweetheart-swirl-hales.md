<div class="img-small-right">![Hale's Ale's Sweetheart Swirl Brewmaster's Dinner](/img/sweetheart-swirl.jpg "Hale's Ale's Sweetheart Swirl Brewmaster's Dinner")</div>If you're looking to add a little bit of Ballard craft beer to your romance, you're in luck this week. Hale's is holding a [brewmaster's dinner](http://halesbrewery.com/hales/index.php?id=463&detail=1103&r=0) with a Valentine theme. The dinner includes "A candlelit four course dinner & ale pairing followed by an evening of music & dancing."

The dinner is Wednesday, February 12th, from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM at Hale's Palladium (around back from the pub). You can call 206-782-0737 for reservations. The price is $80 for a couple and $45 if you're riding solo. Tax and gratuity aren't included in the prices. 

A posting over on [Beer Advocate](http://beeradvocate.com/events/info/65854/) has a lot more info about the menu.
