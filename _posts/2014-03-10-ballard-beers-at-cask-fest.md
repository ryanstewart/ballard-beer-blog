<div class="img-small-right">![Cask Fest 2014](http://www.ballardbeerblog.com/img/posts/cask-beer-fest-logo.png "Caskfest 2014")</div>WABL just sent out the [list of beers](http://washingtonbrewersguild.org/2014_Washington_Cask_Beer%20Festival_beer_list_3.2.14.pdf) (PDF) at [Cask Festival 2014](http://washingtonbrewersguild.org/Festivals_Events.html) and it looks like there are some fantastic beers on offer from Ballard Breweries.

##Giveaway

Unfortunately I have to be gone the weekend of Cask Festival for work, but that means I've got a ticket I can't use. It doesn't look like the event is sold out yet, but it usually does. If you're looking for a free extra ticket, just [email me](mailto:ryan@ballardbeerblog.com) and tell me what you like best about cask beer. The answer I like the best will get the ticket.

Here's what the participating Ballard Breweries are pouring:

###Hale's Ales Brewery
- Barrel Aged Imperial Stout (Imperial Stout)
- Coconut Brown (Brown Ale)
- Double Dry-hopped Supergoose IPA (IPA)
